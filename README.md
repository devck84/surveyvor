# Surveyvor
A multiplatform application where each user (Registered or logged in through Google) can see/create/edit/delete/test the surveys, being able to add, modify and remove questions, these questions can be answered according to the type of answer selected. When creating the survey, the response types may be: Short answer long answer Selection dates ranks E-mail urls Phone number (Questions may or may not be required)  The appearance of the survey can also be changed (Background color and the color of the buttons to advance to the next question)  You can also link questions between them, being able to ignore the next question depending on the answer of the previous one. 
Example:<ul><li> Was the service provided as expected?</li> <li> What should be improved to be as expected? </li> </ul>  If the answer to the first question is “yes”, there would be no point in asking the second question, so it will simply be skipped.  The answers can be both anonymous and with already registered users, thus being able to have friends on the platform, you can also see your friends' surveys if they are public or "close friends", and finally you can also chat with them.  If you are part of a company and the use of the surveys is business, you can create a team to have shared surveys.  In case a user leaves the survey unfinished, the progress will be saved for a while.  The application will also generate reports and statistics of different types based on the responses to each survey.
